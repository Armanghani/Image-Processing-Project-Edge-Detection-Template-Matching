# Image-Processing-Project-Edge-Detection-Template-Matching
This repository presents the implementation of classical image processing algorithms developed as part of the Image Processing course taught by Dr. Yousefpour. The project includes Sobel and Prewitt edge detection as well as character detection using normalized cross-correlation, implemented using basic Python operations.
